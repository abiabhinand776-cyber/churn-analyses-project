 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore, analyze, and visualize a dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights.
The workflow is divided into two main stages:

EDA in Google Colab

Dashboard development in Power BI
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA was performed in Google Colab, using Python libraries such as:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly (optional)
Key Steps in EDA:

Data cleaning

Handling missing values

Feature engineering (if any)

Outlier detection

Statistical summaries

Data visualization

Exporting the cleaned dataset for Power BI
 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI Desktop using the processed dataset.
It includes visuals such as:

KPIs

Bar charts

Line charts

Donut/pie charts

Tables

Filters/slicers
Dashboard Highlights:

Key business metrics

Trend analysis

Category/segment insights

Comparison across groups
